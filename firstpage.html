                BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit.
                Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan 
                Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 and
                 debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The 
                 septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM,
                  Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces 
                  the majority of their material. Originally a hip 
                  hop group, their musical style has evolved to
                   incorporate a wide range of genres, while their 
                   lyricism has focused on subjects including mental
                    health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming
                     of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, 
                     individualism, and the consequences of fame and
                      recognition. Their discography and adjacent work
                       has also referenced literature, philosophy and
                        psychological concepts, and includes an alternate
                         universe storyline.
