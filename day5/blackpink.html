    <p class="my-first-class">Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; RR: Beullaekpingkeu, commonly stylized in all caps or as BLɅϽKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The group debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, respectively.

        Referred to as the "biggest girl group in the world", Blackpink is the most successful Korean girl group internationally. They are the highest-charting female Korean act on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with "Ice Cream" (2020), and on the Billboard 200, peaking at number one with their second studio album Born Pink (2022), which is the best-selling album of all time by a Korean girl group and the first to sell over two million copies.
         They were the first girl group to top the Billboard Artist 100 and the first Korean girl group to enter and top the Billboard Emerging Artists chart.Blackpink also became the first female Korean act to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), whose music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one billion views and is currently the most-viewed by a Korean group on YouTube.
         Their 2018 song "Kiss and Make Up", a collaboration with Dua Lipa, was the first by a Korean group to receive a certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and a platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The group's debut studio album, The Album, (2020), was the first album by a Korean girl group to sell more than one million copies and the highest-charting female Korean album on the Billboard 200 at the 
         time, at number two, both records surpassed by Born Pink. Born Pink was the first album by a K-pop girl group to reach number one on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart; the album's lead single "Pink Venom" (2022) was the first song by a K-pop group to top the ARIA Singles Chart and the first song by a girl group to top the Billboard Global 200.
