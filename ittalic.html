            <i> "A.R.M.Y" stands for "Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth"
            and it carries quite some meaning behind it, given that "Army"
             is associated with the military, body armor, and how those two
              things are always together, the fandom name basically means 
              that fans will always be together with BTS.
